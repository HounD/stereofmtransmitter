I need a stereo fm transmitter / reciever for my experiments, but can't find one. There are some grc examples, but no one works correctly in stereo, so I've done my one. It's not perfect, but can play the signal both generated by the transmitter and anything recorded from the real brodcast.

You can use this git repo any way you like.
